Data is stored in localStorage and can be exported as a CSV file. Built with HTML, CSS, andJavaScript, it features a clean and user-friendly interface

### Project Objective:

To design and develop a web-based Medicine Management System** that enables efficient tracking, storage, and management of medicines in an organized manner. The system aims to optimize storage space, simplify inventory operations, and provide functionalities such as adding, searching, removing medicines, and exporting data for streamlined pharmacy management.

### Key Concepts in Medicine Management System

1. **Inventory Management**: Track and manage medicines, including name, weight, quantity, cost, and storage location.

2. **Drawer Optimization**: Use a **knapsack algorithm** to maximize storage space in predefined drawers.

3. **Local Storage**: Store inventory and drawer data persistently using the browser's localStorage.

4. **Search Functionality**: Efficiently find medicines by name with real-time results.

5. **Data Export**: Convert inventory data into CSV format for external use.

6. **Dynamic Updates**: Adjust inventory and drawer capacities automatically during add/remove operations.

7. **User Interface**: Simple, responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
